## Acknowledgments

I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the following entities for their invaluable support and contributions to my learning journey and the development of this project:

- **ALX Africa**: Thank you for providing a transformative software engineering program that has equipped me with the skills and knowledge needed to pursue a career in technology. Your commitment to fostering talent and promoting lifelong learning is truly commendable.
  
- **Mastercard Foundation**: I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to participate in the ALX Africa program, made possible through your generous sponsorship. Your commitment to empowering African youth with the technical skills and resources necessary to thrive in the global workforce is truly inspiring.
  
- **Fred Swaniker**: I extend my sincere appreciation to Fred Swaniker for his visionary leadership and dedication to creating the next generation of African leaders and innovators. His unwavering belief in the potential of African talent has been instrumental in driving positive change and progress across the continent.

- **Government of Rwanda**: I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Government of Rwanda for its unwavering commitment to fostering technological innovation and digital inclusion. The government's dedication to providing affordable and reliable internet infrastructure, alongside a robust electricity grid, has been instrumental in supporting my learning journey and the development of this project. With mobile data prices among the lowest globally, including the ability to purchase 1GB of data for approximately $0.078 USD, Rwanda's internet accessibility has set a benchmark for affordability and accessibility. Moreover, the stability and reliability of Rwanda's internet infrastructure, coupled with a consistent electricity supply, have ensured uninterrupted access to online resources, facilitating my engagement with the ALX Africa program and the development of BillHub. This contrasts starkly with the challenges faced by my friends in Nigeria, who struggled with power outages, hindering their ability to engage with educational resources and complete projects. The government's proactive investments in both internet and electricity infrastructure have not only empowered individuals like myself but have also catalyzed entrepreneurship, education, and economic growth across the country. I am deeply grateful to the Government of Rwanda for making this project possible and for its continued support in advancing digital connectivity and innovation in Rwanda and beyond.
